Great question! When you're participating in a coding contest, **every millisecond matters**. Let's break it down in terms of **speed** and **efficiency**:

### Why `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` matters in coding contests:

In coding contests, you are usually given large input sizes (sometimes up to millions of integers). The problem is, **input/output operations can be slow**, especially if you have a lot of data. Let's see how this can affect you:

1. **Synchronization between C++ streams and C streams**:
   - In C++, `cin` and `cout` are used for input and output respectively, while in C, we use `scanf` and `printf`.
   - By default, `cin` and `cout` are **synchronized** with C's `stdio` functions (`scanf` and `printf`). This means, **before each input operation (`cin`), the C++ stream is flushed** (i.e., `cout` is cleared and printed to the screen) to make sure it behaves in the same way as the C functions. 

   **Why is this a problem?**
   - This flushing before every input operation takes time. When you have large amounts of data, this flushing slows down the program because it's doing unnecessary work between every input.
   
2. **Turning off synchronization (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`)**:
   - When you turn off synchronization with `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, **C++ streams (`cin`, `cout`) are no longer tied to the C functions**. This means **no flushing happens before every input** operation, and you get **faster I/O**.

   **How does this help in a contest?**
   - In a coding contest, the **input and output** are often the **slowest part of your program**, especially when you're working with large inputs (up to millions of numbers).
   - By disabling synchronization, you're essentially removing a lot of the unnecessary overhead and making your program **faster** at processing input and output. This **can save valuable time** (in terms of milliseconds) that may be the difference between a **Accepted** solution and a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** error.
   
3. **Impact on compilation and submission**:
   - **Compilation Time**: The use of `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` **does not significantly affect compilation time**. It's a small tweak that makes your code run faster during execution, not at the time of compilation.
   - **Execution Time**: During execution, **this optimization can make a noticeable difference** in contest settings. It speeds up the **input and output**, which can be very important when you're dealing with large test cases.
   - In contests, **every test case has a time limit**, so making I/O faster can **reduce the total running time**, which makes your solution more likely to pass all the test cases within the time limits.

### Why `cin.tie(NULL)` helps:
- **`cin.tie(NULL)`** unties `cin` from `cout`, which means it **stops automatically flushing `cout` before `cin` every time**.
  - Normally, before every `cin`, `cout` is flushed (which can be slow).
  - By untangling them, you save some extra time that was previously spent on unnecessary flushing.

### Example: Why this helps in coding contests

Suppose you're given a problem where you need to read a large number of integers and process them. If you don't optimize your input/output, here's what might happen:
- **With synchronization and tied streams**:
  - Every time you do a `cin` operation, the program also flushes the `cout` buffer, which can take time.
  - This is especially bad when you're reading millions of integers, as **flushing takes a lot of unnecessary time**.

- **With `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(NULL)`**:
  - These tweaks ensure **no flushing** occurs during input, making the input operations **faster**.
  - This can **drastically reduce the total time taken** to process all input/output, potentially saving valuable time that makes your program faster.

### Summary:
- **In a coding contest**, **time limits** are strict, and even small optimizations can make a difference between a solution that **works within the time limits** (Accepted) and one that **fails due to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)**.
- **Disabling synchronization** (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`) and **untangling `cin` and `cout`** (`cin.tie(NULL)`) **speeds up input and output**, which can be **crucial** when handling large input sizes.
